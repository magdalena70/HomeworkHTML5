				<p><span class="big">W</span><span class="italic">eb colors are colors used in designing web pages,
				and the methods for describing and specifying those colors.</span></p>
				<p>Colors may be specified as an RGB triplet or in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet).
				They may also be specified according to their common English names in some cases.
				Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to generate color values. 
				In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading number 
				sign (#).[1][2] A color is specified according to the intensity of its red, green and blue components,
				each represented by eight bits. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color, and 16,777,216
				colors that may be so specified.</p>

				<header id="orange-header">Web Safe Colors</header>
				<p><span class="big">A</span><span class="italic">t one time many computer displays were only capable of displaying
				256 colors. These may be dictated by the</span></p>
				<p>hardware or changeable by a "color table". When a color is found (e.g., in an image)
				that is not one available, a different one has to be used. This can be done by either using the
				closest color, which greatly speeds up the load time, or by using dithering, which results in more
				accurate results, but takes longer to load due to the complex calculations.
				There were various attempts to make a "standard" color palette. A set of colors was needed that
				could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because
				computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it
				was also selected because it allows exactly six equally-spaced shades of red, green, and blue
				(6 × 6 × 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).</p>

				<header id="yellow-header">RGB Color Mode</header>
				<p><span class="big">T</span><span class="italic">he RGB color model is an additive color model in which
				red, green, and blue light are addedtogether in various ways</span></p>
				<p>to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the 
				three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. The main purpose of the RGB color model is 
				for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and
				computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. Before the electronic age,
				the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.</p>

				<header id="green-header">RGBA Color Space</header>
				<p><span class="big">R</span><span class="italic">GBA stands for red green blue alpha.
				While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually simply a use of the </span></p>
				<p>RGB color model, with extra information. The color is RGB, and may belong to any RGB color space,
				but an integral alpha value as invented by Catmull and Smith between 1971 and 1972 enables alpha
				compositing. The inventors named alpha after the Greek letter in the classic linear interpolation
				formula αA + (1-α)B. The alpha channel is normally used as an opacity channel. If a pixel has a value
				of 0% in its alpha channel, it is fully transparent (and, thus, invisible), whereas a value of 100%
				in the alpha channel gives a fully opaque pixel (traditional digital images). Values between 0% and 100%
				make it possible for pixels to show through a background like a glass (translucency),
				an effect not possible with simple binary (transparent or opaque) transparency.
				It allows easy image compositing.</p>

				<header id="lightgreen-header">HSL and HSV</header>
				<p><span class="big">H</span><span class="italic">HSL and HSV are the two most common
				cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model. </span></p>
				<p>Developed in the 1970s for computer graphics applications, HSL and HSV are used today in color pickers,
				in image editing software, and less commonly in image analysis and computer vision.
				The two representations rearrange the geometry of RGB in an attempt to be more intuitive and
				perceptually relevant than the cartesian (cube) representation, by mapping the values into a cylinder
				loosely inspired by a traditional color wheel. The angle around the central vertical axis corresponds
				to "hue" and the distance from the axis corresponds to "saturation". These first two values give the two
				schemes the 'H' and 'S' in their names. The height corresponds to a third value, the system's 
				representation of the perceived luminance in relation to the saturation.</p>
